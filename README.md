The Wildfire Risk DSS combines wildfire simulation and decision science methods to visualize the integrated risk of wildfire on a geospatial map. A key feature of the tool is the manner in which a decision maker can interactively explore various dimensions of risk geospatially in order to draw conclusions from the data and make decisions to mitigate risk.

The users of the DSS include community planners and asset manager,  who will need to be able to prioritize infrastructure development to support areas that are most at-risk for wildfires, and community developers, who need to quantify the wildfire risk of proposed residential communities and construction projects. This tool will be useful for small to midsize municipalities, construction companies, and companies with fields assets who need to evaluate wildfire risk but cannot spare the cost for an expensive analytics platform from a large software vendor. Since the Wildfire Risk DSS uses open-source software, the only costs for customers will be services required to connect the tool to the existing IT infrastructure and import the required datasets. 

One main decision support feature of the DSS is a heat map that visually represents a risk model using a variety of measures such as terrain type, exposure to wind, historic fire locations, road access, slope of the terrain, and others. Weights are assigned to each of the attributes and combined to produce an overall wildfire risk score for the location. Using the geospatial risk heat map, the user will be able to quickly understand the wildfire risk for an area of interest. A second decision support feature is a table that displays similar data to the heat map in a tabular format.
